# Markdown to PDF converter

This reusable workflow can be used to publish PDF from Markdown using a predefined latex template.

It use the following logic:

1. Get version history:
   1. If a **HistoryFile** exist; use the content of that file.
   1. Or, if **ForceDefault** is set to `true`; use the value of **DefaultAuthor** and **DefaultDescription**.
   1. Or, use git commit history. Limit the number of items to the value of **LimitVersionHistory**.
1. Merge the markdown files listed in the OrderFile to one markdown file.
1. If a **ReplaceFile** exist; replace in the markdown each string that match the key from **ReplaceFile**, with the matching value.
1. Build and display metadata for the pandoc converter.
1. Convert the markdown using pandoc and save it as an artifact to the job.

The markdown can include admonition blocks for text that need special attention.

The following blocks are supported: warning, important, note, caution, tip

Example:

```markdown
# A title

This is some regular text.

::: tip
This text is in a tip admonition block.
:::
```

## Issues

The following are known issues:

- Markdown table columns can overlap in the PDF if the table is to wide, making text unreadable. To work around this:
  - limit the text in the table. Typically it should be less than 80 characters wide.
  - split the table up.
  - use an ordered or unordered list.
- The template is designed for a standing A4 layout. It has no option to flip page orientation for one or several pages in a document.
- Titles are not automatically numbered. Titles can be manually numbered and maintained in the markdown document. To avoid having to manually update all titles, it is best to not use numbered titles if possible.
- Because the template is based on latex, backslash has a special meaning and can therefore cause an error from pandoc.
